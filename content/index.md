Hi there! 👋 My name is Chris and I am an Engineering Manager at [Telness Tech](https://telnesstech.com/). You can learn about myself and my full resume [[about|here]] and you can always [[contact|get in touch]].

Why I created this website is because I am a huge fan of [learning in public](https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549) and believe in transparency, openness and communication. I also strive to share what I have learned and give back to the community.

Here are some places where I like to write and share my ideas:
## [[tech/index|Tech digital garden]]

This is my digital garden for software engineering and the tech industry as a whole. I tend to write more guides and personal notes on what I have learned and what I would like to learn in the future. All feedback is welcome! Call me an idiot if you have to 😃
## [[blog/index|Blog]]

Here you will find my more casual writings and sharing of stories, learnings, and topics that interest me in a lot of different ways. I write on a wide range of topics including tech, personal development, daily reflections, music, and more!
## [[stockholm-dj|DJ]]

One of my many passions is DJing and I have page dedicated to just that! Here you can find out more about what kind of gigs I do and my pricing in case you would like to book me (there is no pressure though hehe) 🎧
