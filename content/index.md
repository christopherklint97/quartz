Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Chris and I am Engineering Manager at [Telness Tech](https://telnesstech.com/).

Why I created this website is because I am a huge fan of [learning in public](https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549) and believe in transparency, openness and communication. I also strive to share what I have learned and give back to the community.

Here are some places where I like to write and share my ideas:
## [[tech/index|Tech Digital Garden]]

This is my digital garden for software engineering and the tech industry as a whole. I tend to write more guides and personal notes on what I have learned and what I would like to learn as well. All feedback is welcome! Call me an idiot if you have to ðŸ˜ƒ
## [[blog/index|Blog]]

Here you will find my more casual writings and sharing of stories, learnings, and topics that interest me in a lot of different ways.
## [[stockholm-dj|DJ]]

One of my many passions is DJing and I have page dedicated to just that! If you are interested in learning more that check it out ðŸŽ§
