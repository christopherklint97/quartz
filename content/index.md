Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Chris and I am Director of Technology & Innovation at [Nenda](https://nenda.com/). You can learn about myself and my full resume [on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherklint/) and you can always [[contact|get in touch]].

Why I created this website is because I wanted to have a space for writing out my thoughts and working through different concepts that are not just stuck in my head. Sometimes I like to rant as well, so it's a mix of both!
