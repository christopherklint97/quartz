## No-nonsense Stockholm DJ with your perfect mix

Why does finding a DJ have to be so difficult? All that you are looking for is someone to come with the right music in the perfect mix to bring your event to the next level. I personally remember my own wedding DJ who couldn't even mix the songs correctly but just played the next one when the first song ended...

Seriously? A Spotify playlist crossfader would have been just as good. And **cheaper**.

## What a DJ should be

I believe that the perfect mix is something that can be created both for the ones hosting the event and for the DJ. This can be done in a collaborative way if you feel that you want control over what music should be played, or if you just want to dance the night away, that's fine! 

What is most important is to ensure that the best music is being mixed so that your event is the one that no one will forget!

I love DJing at:
- Weddings
- Company events/openings
- Private parties
- Student events
- Clubs
- And more!
