Welcome to my tech digital garden where I keep my PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System). The purpose of this space is to learn in public and provide resources to help others understand various topics in the tech industry. My goal is to contribute to the community by sharing insights, industry best practices, and practical know-how about specific subjects.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a concept popularized by developers and creators who use their websites to cultivate knowledge openly and iteratively. It's a space where ideas, notes, and learning resources grow over time, often in an interconnected manner.

## Why Maintain a PKMS?

Maintaining a PKMS allows me to share my learning journey as I attempt to demystify complex topics and encourage transparent learning. I aim to offer valuable resources that others can benefit from, whether they're beginners or experienced professionals. Creating an open dialogue around industry best practices fosters a community of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
