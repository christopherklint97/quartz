## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can rent these resources on an as-needed basis from cloud service providers.

## Key benefits of Cloud Computing

1. Easily scale up or down based on demand without the need for significant upfront investments.
2. Pay only for what you use, reducing capital expenditures on hardware and software.
3. Access resources and services from anywhere in the world, facilitating remote work and collaboration.
4. Benefit from high availability, disaster recovery, and backup services offered by cloud providers.
5. Quickly deploy and iterate on applications, leveraging cutting-edge technologies provided by cloud platforms.
